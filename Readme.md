My first project :

Started from a penetration of simulation in the competitive market
work , my pretense is not nearly be a programmer
petitive in the labor market , since my old age I do not
allows me to risk such a competition , but even a person
Old as I can not abandon your dreams, then with the help of my
friend and great teacher Volney Casas .
We decided to do a little market research in the neighborhood where I live only
to test what would be the acceptance of a junior developer , since a
age be taken seriously . There were many of our sources
study mined the Internet, www.bosontreinamentos.com.br , Python
for Zombies, Zero Ignorance among many other tutorials and documentation
Python rolling over the Internet, even without a master to us auxliar
directly and through the blinds . We found a reasonable acceptance
near the small traders visited , and heard their interests in
computerize your small business. This added incentive as the
speaker and today my personal friend " Henrique Bastos ," a promoter
hangout 's highly rated among the programmers " Eric Hideki " and
of integramtes group https://www.facebook.com/groups/python.brasil/
Who encouraged me much to post here on GitHub , and eager to
check the reviews of many programmers and students attending
these groups ... With my respects !
